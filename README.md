# hello-world
Hi! I'm Megan. I've been a web developer for almost *10 years* now! But this wasn't always what I planned to do.

I attended college hoping to someday publish books. I earned a degree in English Professional Writing. I graduated and moved to a big city where I thought I'd find a job reading and editing manuscripts.

And then the U.S. economy collapsed.

The whole country scrambled for whatever jobs could be had, and I scrambled right with them. I found a position at a marketing agency as a tester, checking through newly developed websites for errors and display issues. When I told them that I had enough basic HTML knowledge to fix some of the small bugs I found, I didn't realize that I was at one of those foundational crossroads that plots the course of your life. I suppose that's kinda how life works.

So here I am, brushing up on git and flexin' my JS.

If I sound cool, you should talk to me!

As a terrible/incredible wizard I like has said,
HAVE A MAGICAL DAY!
